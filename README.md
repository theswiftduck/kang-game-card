- Players: 4 (actually can play 2-6 players. But current version for this is only support 4).
- The objective of this game is to make cards in our hand to reach minimum score compare to other player.
- For score, A is 1 that is >2>3>4>5>6>7>8>9>10, for J,K,Q are 10.
- Card from deck will be distributed to each player 5-6 or 6-7 ea. per player. The first player will get 6 if play 5-6 ea. or 7 if play 6-7 ea.
- First player in only first turn will have to drop a card to reduce their score. Then they can choose to 'Kang' or 'Pass'. 'Kang' is to end the game and it's mean they confident that they have min score compare to other. If it's not then they will lose.
- If first player choose to pass. Next player will have a chance to drop their card if they have card(s) with same number (A,1-10,J,K,Q) with dropped card from other player previous turn then they can choose to 'Kang' or 'pass'. Unless they have only choice to pick a card from deck. Then drop (a) card(s). Then they have choices to 'Kang' or 'pass'.
- So on.. Until the deck is empty and everyone in this game have to compare their score, if no one 'Kang' in this game.
- When players have a chance to drop card. If they have same number in hand thye can drop all of it in one turn e.g. previous player dropped 9♠️. and next player have 9♥️ 9♦️ 9♣️. this player can drop all 3 (or 2 or 4 if they have it) ea. of '9' card in one turn. This is possible if they have 2-4 same card number.
- In this game. I have refer each card with char 'XY'. X = {A:♠️,B:♥️,C:♦️,D:♣️} and Y = {1:A, 2:2, 3:3,...,9:9,X:10,J:J,Q:Q,K:K} for example:
    - If you have DX, BQ, A1 and CX in your hand. Meaning that you have 🃚, 🂽, 🂡 and 🃊 consequently.
- This project is not completed yet. This is just very alpha version.
- Enjoy!
- Just for fun!
